Hello! I am a freelance business consultant and developer running [Telaco](https://www.telaco.com). I help people develop new ideas, processes and prototypes. I keep a journal and month notes on my [personal website](https://www.jamiemchale.com).

I'm currently working on client projects for web apps using JavaScript (mostly React/Node) and PHP. 

I run the [EdinburghJS](https://www.edinburghjs.org) monthly JavaScript meetup.
